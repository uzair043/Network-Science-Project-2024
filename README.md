# Network Science Project 2024

## Steps to Install/Execute the project
If you are using Anaconda, then most of the packages will be available already, but still you need the following packages to run the project: 
```
pandas
networkx
matplotlib
scipy
```
Once you have all the packages installed, you need to have the following files with you: 
```
Network_Science_Project_2024
wikiElec.ElecBs3.xls
```

The `Network_Science_Project_2024` is a jupyter notebook file and the `wikiElec.ElecBs3.xls` is the data file. You need to have the data file in the same folder as in the jupyter notebook file to make them work. 

After you have both files, you just need to run each cell in the sequential order to make it work. It will take time to draw graph but other cells should not take much time to run.
